# Todo List Project

This project is a simple Todo List application built using Go and HTMX. It is my first experience working with both of these technologies.

## Description

This Todo List application allows users to add their tasks. The main purpose of this project was to get hands-on experience with Go as a backend language and HTMX for creating interactive web interfaces without the need for JavaScript.

## Features

- Add new tasks

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: Used for the backend logic and server-side operations.
- **HTMX**: Used for dynamic and interactive web content without writing JavaScript.
